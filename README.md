## Overview

In the vast expanse of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (SMVDU), numerous student clubs 
actively operate, each with its unique purpose, events, and activities. While these clubs are the 
lifeblood of campus culture, keeping track of their multifaceted activities can be a daunting task for students.
